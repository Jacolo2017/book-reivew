            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                To most of us, learning something "the hard way" implies wasteed time and effort. Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different learing styles of students and should use stratagies that make learning easier. Make It Stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners.
